        <h2>THE ANTARCTIC BLUE WHALE - BIGGEST ANIMAL ON THE PLANET - 200 TONS</h2>
        <p>The Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus ssp. Intermedia) is the biggest animal on the planet, weighing up to 400,000 pounds (approximately 33 elephants) and reaching up to 98 feet in length. The whale has a heart the size of a small car,
            and during the main feeding season, it consumes around 7936 pounds of krill per day. It is the loudest animal on Earth, even louder than a jet engine -- its calls reach 188 decibels while a jet reaches 140 decibels. The whales' low-frequency
            whistle can be heard for hundreds of miles and is probably used to attract other blue whales.</p>

        <p>Megalodon (Otodus megalodon),meaning "big tooth", is an extinct species of mackerel shark that lived approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago (Mya), from the Early Miocene to the Pliocene epochs. It was formerly thought to be a member of the
            family Lamnidae and a close relative of the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). However, it is now classified into the extinct family Otodontidae, which diverged from the great white shark during the Early Cretaceous.The most recent
            estimate with the least error range suggests a maximum length estimate up to 20 meters (66 ft), although the modal lengths are estimated at 10.5 meters (34 ft). Extrapolation from a vertebral centra with dimensions based on the great white
            shark suggests that a megalodon about 16 meters (52 ft) long weighs up to 48 metric tons (53 short tons), 17 meters (56 ft) long weighs up to 59 metric tons (65 short tons), and 20.3 meters (67 ft) long (the maximum length) weighs up to 103

            horrifying). Take Basilosaurus, whose three-foot skull you can see in our Evolving Planet exhibition. Recent studies have suggested that this 60-foot leviathan had a bite force to rival that of T. rex, which it put to good use cracking open
            the skulls of other, smaller whales (you can see Basilosaurus tooth marks on their skulls).Measuring 15–20 m (49–66 ft), Basilosaurus is one of the largest animals known to exist between the K–Pg extinction event 66 million years ago (mya)

        <h2>STELLER'S SEA COW - GIGANTIC MARINE MAMMAL - 24 TONS</h2>
        <p>Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) is an extinct sirenian described by Georg Wilhelm Steller in 1741. At that time, it was found only around the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia; its range extended across the North
            Pacific during the Pleistocene epoch, and likely contracted to such an extreme degree due to the glacial cycle. It is possible indigenous populations interacted with the animal before Europeans. Steller first encountered it on Vitus Bering's
            Great Northern Expedition when the crew became shipwrecked on Bering Island. Much of what is known about its behavior comes from Steller's observations on the island, documented in his posthumous publication On the Beasts of the Sea. Within
            27 years of its discovery by Europeans, the slow-moving and easily-caught mammal was hunted into extinction for its meat, fat, and hide.Steller's sea cows are reported to have grown to 8 to 9 m (26 to 30 ft) long as adults, much larger than
            extant sirenians.[6] In 1987, a rather complete skeleton was found on Bering Island measuring 3 m (9.8 ft).[7][8] In 2017, another such skeleton was found on Bering Island measuring 5.2 m (17 ft), and in life probably about 6 m (20 ft).[9]
            Georg Steller's writings contain two contradictory estimates of weight: 4 and 24.3 Tons.</p>

        <p>Ever since its scattered, oversized remains were discovered in the early 20th century, Indricotherium has occasioned controversy among paleontologists, who have named this giant mammal not once, but three times--Indricotherium, Paraceratherium
            and Baluchitherium have all been in common usage, with the first two currently battling it out for supremacy. (For the record, Paraceratherium seems to have won the race among paleontologists, but Indricotherium is still preferred by the general
            public--and may yet wind up being assigned to a separate, but similar, genus.) Whatever you choose to call it, Indricotherium was, hands-down, the largest terrestrial mammal that ever lived, approaching the size of the giant sauropod dinosaurs
            that preceded it by over a hundred million years. An ancestor of the modern rhinoceros, the 15-to-20-ton Indricotherium had a relatively long neck (though nothing approaching what you'd see on a Diplodocus or Brachiosaurus) and surprisingly
            thin legs with three-toed feet, which years ago used to be portrayed as elephant-like stumps. The fossil evidence is lacking, but this huge herbivore probably possessed a prehensile upper lip--not quite a trunk, but an appendage flexible enough
            to allow it to grab and tear the tall leaves of trees.</p>

        <p>Mosasaurus ("lizard of the Meuse River") is the type genus (defining example) of the mosasaurs, an extinct group of aquatic squamate reptiles. It lived from about 82 to 66 million years ago during the Campanian and Maastrichtian stages of the

            Traditional interpretations have estimated the maximum length of the largest species, M. hoffmannii, to be up to 17.1 meters (56 ft), making it one of the largest mosasaurs, although some scientists consider this an overestimation with recent

        <h2>TITANOBOA - SUPER SERPENT - 1 TON</h2>
        <p>Titanoboa is an extinct genus of very large snakes that lived in what is now La Guajira in northeastern Colombia. They could grow up to 12.8 m (42 ft), perhaps even 14.3 m (47 ft) long and reach a weight of 1,135 kg (2,500 lb). This snake lived
            during the Middle to Late Paleocene epoch, around 60 to 58 million years ago following the extinction of the dinosaurs. Although originally thought to be an apex predator, the discovery of skull bones revealed that it was more than likely
            specialized in preying on fish. The only known species is Titanoboa cerrejonensis, the largest snake ever discovered, which supplanted the previous record holder, Gigantophis garstini.</p>

        <h2>ANDREWSARCHUS - SCARY WOLF-HYENA? - 1 TON</h2>
        <p>Reconstructed on the basis of a single, enormous skul—discovered by the famous fossil-hunter Roy Chapman Andrews during an expedition to the Gobi Desert—Andrewsarchus was a 13-foot-long, one-ton meat eater that may well have feasted on megafauna
            mammals like Brontotherium (the "thunder beast"). Given its enormous jaws, Andrewsarchus may also have supplemented its diet by biting through the hard shells of equally gigantic prehistoric turtles!</p>
